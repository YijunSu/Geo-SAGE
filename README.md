A Geographical Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial Item Recommendation

Geo-SAGE leverages sparse additive model to recommend point of interests （POI） not only in-town but also out-of-town. The details please refer to KDD 2015 paper "Geo-SAGE: A Geographical Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial Item Recommendation". The implementation is based on <a href="http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">standford nlp</a> library, we include it in the lib directory.
